  <h3>Day 9: Networking </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
<p> Overview: <p>
<p> For Tuesday's assignment, I decided to recrete the in-class LED communication with a wireless bluetooth. For my final project, I'm using a HC-06 Bluetooth, and I wanted to see if I can program this bluetooth with Huzzah. I used MIT's app inventor to make a basic app that has turn on and off feature instead of using the IP address to turn my LED's. <p>


<p> Here is an image of the circuit. <p>

<p> Here is the front page of the app that I created using the MIT's App Inventor. <p>

<p> Here is the block code of the app. <p>

<p> Final Result: <p>
<p> For the Bluetooth model to work, I need to supply 5 bolts, but the huzzah boards only had the 3v. The code had no probelem, but the app couldn't recognize the bluetooth. There was an "515 Error" when I tried turning on the LED through the app. I'm still troubleshooting the problem, but if this doesn't work on huzzah board, I wil try it on the microcontroller once the new one arrives. <p>
