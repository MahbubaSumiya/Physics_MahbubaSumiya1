        <p> For the day 2 assignment, we were asked to create items that are in the kit that we received for the course. I was hoping to design a tire using Fusion 360, but I didn't really had much success. Here are just two of my designs. I have attempted seven differents drafts, and these are just two that I think came out pretty decent. </p>
