  <h2>Why did I want to make this?</h2>
</header>

<html>
<body>

<p style="font-size:30px">The key to avoid piling dust is to clear the surface of a table, phone, and many more regularly. While at home, my mom usually vacuums every weekend, but I recently started to  recognize that the dust on my study table never goes away. 
During the time at this course, my study area, especially the table was filled with dust particles because of the amount of time I had to cut cardboards and other stuff from the garage. My parents would rarely come to my room for that reason because they struggle with breathing issues and allergies. This started to get even worse when my sister started using the place for her project while the fan is turned on. 
I have been thinking about this project for a while and had several different ideas. My initial idea was to make a mini car that can climb on the window and clean dust there. Then, my plan switched to making a remote controlled car that can clean floors, more like a vacuum. I switched from this idea because I thought it just won’t be as beneficial to me if I decide to keep it. Then the idea about cleaning my own study table came when I saw all the dusts floating around me and I did not feel like cleaning them. I wished I had something that could clean it for me. Later from there, I started drawing on my sketchbook how I would do that to look. Even though the final product does not look identical as my drawing, I’m still happy with the way it turned out.

  <h2>What are the functions?</h2>
</header>

<html>
<body>

<p style="font-size:30px">The motors attached to the wheels are controlled with 5V and GND from microcontrollers. 
The ultrasonic sensor is allowing me to monitor any obstacles upfront. This sensor also has a threshold limit and once an obstacle is detected within that threshold, the piezo buzzer emits sounds. 
The servo motor attached at the bottom of the model is rotating 180 degrees. The intention of using the sponge is to clean any dusts on the surface.

  <h2>The breakdowns of the different elements of the project</h2>
</header>

<html>
<body>

<p style="font-size:30px">The servo motor is controlled with the code on the bottom: </p>
<pre><code>
// Include the Servo library 
#include <Servo.h> 

Servo servo;

void setup() {

  servo.attach(9);

  
}

void loop() {

servo.write(0);
delay(3000);
servo.write(300);
delay(500);

}

</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:30px">The ultrasonic sensor is controlled with the code on the bottom: </p>
<pre><code>
const int trigPin = 9;
const int echoPin = 10;

long duration;
int distance;
int safetyDistance;

void setup() {
pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); 
pinMode(echoPin, INPUT); 
Serial.begin(9600); 
}
void loop() {
digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(2);
digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(10);
digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);


duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);

// Calculating  distance
distance= duration*0.034/2;

safetyDistance = distance;
if (safetyDistance <= 100)
{
Serial.println(distance);
  Serial.println("distance");

}

</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:30px">The buzzer is controlled with the code on the bottom: </p>

<pre><code>
const int buzzer = 11;

void setup() {
pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT);

void loop() {

  Serial.println("buzz");

tone(buzzer, 300, 1000);
  
  

}
else{
  noTone(buzzer);
 
}
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:30px">Only some minor changes was made in the final code for this project:  </p>
<pre><code>
#include <Servo.h> 

Servo servo;
const int trigPin = 9;
const int echoPin = 10;
const int buzzer = 11;

// defines variables
long duration;
int distance;
int safetyDistance;


void setup() {
 servo.attach(9);
pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); 
pinMode(echoPin, INPUT); 
pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT);
Serial.begin(9600); 
}


void loop() {
servo.write(0);
delay(3000);
servo.write(300);
delay(500);



digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(2);


digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(10);
digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);


duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);

// Calculating  distance
distance= duration*0.034/2;

safetyDistance = distance;
if (safetyDistance <= 100)
{
  Serial.println("buzz");
  Serial.println(distance);
  Serial.println("distance");

  tone(buzzer, 300, 1000);
  
  

}
else{
  noTone(buzzer);
 
}


Serial.print("Distance: ");
Serial.println(distance);
}

</code></pre>
<p style="font-size:30px">The only library that was necessary to include was the servo. No special library was necessary to include for the ultrasonic sensor or the piezo buzzer. </p>

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
</header>

<html>
<body>

<h2>What I hope to improve...</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I hope to find a way to organize the jumper wires. As of now, it is all over the place. While I was trying to take the video, some of my jumper wires were coming off and I had to connect them constantly to the right place. 
</li>
  <li>I hope to find a way to control the DC gear motor with batteries. I had an extra board at home before and I used that to get a 5V connection for one of my motors. I had to buy an additional metro board last minute because I did not know Dc gear motor would not get enough power if there is already one of the same motor getting 5v.</li>
  <li>I hope to find a way to control this car with a joystick or a phone app. 
</li>

 </ul>

  <h2>Key Learning</h2>
</header>

<html>
<body>

<h2>What I learned...</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I came to this class knowing nothing about programming and only basic knowledge about computer usage. This class was difficult for me at first, but as I continued to get more engaged with the final project, things started making sense to me. 

</li>
  <li>Building circuits and getting data on the serial monitor fascinated me when I was able to do it. 
</li>
  <li>Being able to program a website was always on the list, but I never really knew where to start until this class.  
</li>
<li>Debugging codes or circuits is not always fun, but when I was able to recognize why something did not work and be able to fix some aspect of it encouraged me to learn. </li>

 </ul>
