        <p>For this assignment, I first tested different objects to see what I get on my serial plotter. For my results, I got all different types of graphs. </p>

        <p>Below is my result from the class session. <p>

       <p> Final Project Thoughts:</p>  


       <p> For my end of the course final project, I hope to create a mini robot that can climb and still be able to balance on window to clean dirts. As of now, I'm still a beginner in programming, but I willing to learn as I'm going through the Intro to Digital Fabrication course and creating the final project. My hope is that by the end of this course, I'm able to program on Arduino IDE more comfortably and happy with my final product. <p>
