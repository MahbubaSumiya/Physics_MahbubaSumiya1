  <h3>Week 6: Machine Building</h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">

<p> Thoughts: <p>
<p>
For the machine building assignment, I created an app through MIT's app inventor to control my schematic through an android phone. These past two weeks, I have been exploring the MIT’s app inventor for my project and I thought I would incorporate some parts of it in a couple class assignments. However, one part of my project that was giving me a hard time is the HC- 06 bluetooth. I have been trying to get it to connect on the android phone, but had no success even after several attempts. The phone recognizes the bluetooth, but I get the following error “507 unable to connect.”

<p> Progress:  <p>

<p> Here is a picture of the circuit that I built. I wasn’t quite sure how to connect the 5V pin with two different wires. At first, I tried wiring both of the wires that need to connect to the 5V pin on the breadboard’s same row- that didn’t work. Then, I tried looking at the internet for help. I had no success because questions that other people had about wiring 5V pins with multiple wires was different than mine. <p>

<p> Here is the code that was uploaded on Arduino IDE. <p>
	
	<p> const int trigPin = 3; const int echoPin = 2; long duration, cm;

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication with HC-06:
  Serial.begin(9600);  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  // The sensor is triggered by a HIGH pulse of 10 or more microseconds. // Give a short LOW pulse beforehand to ensure a clean HIGH pulse:  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
  delayMicroseconds(2);  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);  
  delayMicroseconds(10);  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  // Read the signal from the sensor: a HIGH pulse whose  // duration is the time (in microseconds) from the sending  // of the ping to the reception of its echo off of an object.
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  // convert the time into a distance
  cm = (duration/2)/29.1;
  if(cm < 20)
  {
    Serial.print("d"); delay(400);
  }
  else
  {
    Serial.print("n"); delay(400);
  }  
}

<p> MIT’s App Inventor Progress: <p>
<p> I used some of the skills that I learned from last week’s assignment to make this app. It is pretty basic, but does the job well (except the bluetooth doesn’t connect). 
Here is the design of the app: <p>
